08/15 Mostly 1st/2nd rounds: Sidekick is typically recommending me London / gibbs / Marv at the top everytime in the early 2nd to pair with garret / puka, 
to make sure I have differing combos of the 1/2 turn guys, I'll sometimes pull up Deebo / Nico / Waddle. 


08/17 Teams at the 3/4 turn Ending up with a lot of Diggs / Zay, would pull up Rashee sometimes to make sure I got some of him (sometimes with Mahomes). Tried to get a ton of different combos of Hou v Bal players there as I like that W17 game.

08/18 an episode of Legendary sickos with Rich Hribar made me feel underweight Rachaad freakin White of all people, so I started pulling him up a bit in the 5/6th on teams I didnt have a RB. Like Mahomes / Worthy stack at the 4/5 as well.
Kinda feel I spread my exposures too thin through the first few rounds, maybe I tried to not draft the "same team" too hard. Waddle my highest exposure at 19% through the first 3 rounds :/
