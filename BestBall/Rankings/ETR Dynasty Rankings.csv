"38","61","Josh Jacobs","LV","RB","25.3","RB11","RB11","Veteran","Dominant 2022 in terms of workload and production. Tagged for 2023."
"39","62","Tony Pollard","DAL","RB","26.1","RB12","RB12","Veteran","Free of Zeke, and Dallas did not add a secondary RB of note in the draft."

"62","85","Derrick Henry","TEN","RB","29.4","RB16","RB16","Veteran","Seems like Titans are shopping Henry, but they will likely be a poor 2023 offense in what looks like a tear down."
"63","86","Cam Akers","LAR","RB","24.0","RB17","RB17","Veteran","Averaged 18 PPR PPG the last 6 weeks of the season -- perhaps finally fully healthy."
"66","87","Rhamondre Stevenson","NE","RB","25.3","RB18","RB18","Veteran","Expecting the 2022 rookies to play more, but there is definitely elite workload upside here."
"224","88","Russell Wilson","DEN","QB","34.5","QB23","QB23","Veteran","Payton seems to genuinly dislike Russ -- move to Stidham would not surprise."

"234","91","Geno Smith","SEA","QB","32.7","QB25","QB25","Veteran","Three-year deal with Seattle is front-loaded, but they continue to add pass catchers."

"71","96","Calvin Ridley","JAC","WR","28.5","WR36","WR36","Veteran","Won't be 29 until the end of the season. No football in two years is concerning, but ascending offense."

"124","114","Luke Musgrave","GB","TE","22.8","TE16","TE16","Rookie","Should start right away -- some concerns over pass volume."
"94","115","Dalvin Cook","MIN","RB","27.8","RB25","RB25","Veteran","Pass game role fell off last year, and it seems the team is ready to move on."
