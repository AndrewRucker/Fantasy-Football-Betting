"36","59","Jameson Williams","DET","WR","22.3","WR24","WR24","Veteran","Burner who played sparingly as a rookie but still flashed immense talent. Will serve a 6-game suspension to start 2023."

"62","85","Derrick Henry","TEN","RB","29.5","RB16","RB16","Veteran","Seems like Titans are shopping Henry, but they will likely be a poor 2023 offense in what looks like a tear down."
"63","86","Cam Akers","LAR","RB","24.0","RB17","RB17","Veteran","Averaged 18 PPR PPG the last 6 weeks of the season -- perhaps finally fully healthy."
"64","87","Rhamondre Stevenson","NE","RB","25.4","RB18","RB18","Veteran","Expecting the 2022 rookies to play more, but there is definitely elite workload upside here."
"242","88","Russell Wilson","DEN","QB","34.6","QB23","QB23","Veteran","Payton seems to genuinly dislike Russ -- move to Stidham would not surprise."

"70","97","Calvin Ridley","JAC","WR","28.5","WR36","WR36","Veteran","Won't be 29 until the end of the season. No football in two years is concerning, but ascending offense."

"82","105","Joe Mixon","CIN","RB","26.9","RB22","RB22","Veteran","Future remains unclear, though the team made just a Day 3 addition in the draft."
"83","106","J.K. Dobbins","BAL","RB","24.5","RB23","RB23","Veteran","Baltimore seemed to lean into him as the bellcow down the stretch. No draft competition added."
