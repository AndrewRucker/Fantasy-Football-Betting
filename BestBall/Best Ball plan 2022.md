## Best Ball Plan 



> This is a comprehensive plan to what I believe is the optimal way to build a portfolio of best ball teams across multiple contests in a single season. Backed by data of historical win/advance rates and top 2% teams in Fanball 10/Underdog contests.


### Position sizing
Given the high variance nature of the game we are playing, along with the top heavy payout structure in these contests it is important that I understand my monetary exposure to these contests should realistically expect to be cut in fourth to cut in half in the bottom outcomes performance wise.

With that understanding, the draft kings millionaire best ball tournament will be my highest exposure tournament that I will max out in. I will have 150 teams in it, and it will be my main focus. 

- At $20 an entry, 150 teams will equate to $3,000 of exposure on DraftKings.

Throughout the summer, the other large field tournament available will be Best Ball Mania 3 on Underdog. At $25 per entry, I am split on participating in this. It will be the sharpest field I’m considering playing in, with the community of drafters being ones focused on structure, player profiles, and have a lot of the same takes as myself. It would seem to me that I don’t have as much edge here as I do with the Draftkings tournament which at a surface level probably has a weaker field. On top of that, in order to have a good 'shot' at being on the right side of variance at the end of the year, this is also the most costly way to do so, with the most top heavy prize structure there is.

**Due to this, I will commit to not participating at all in best ball mania 3.**

*Maybe this changes next year with confirmed edge and profitability, for now it just doesnt make sense considering my bank roll*
