## Best Ball Plan 



> This is a comprehensive plan to what I believe is the optimal way to build a portfolio of best ball teams across multiple contests in a single season. Backed by data of historical win/advance rates and top 2% teams in Fanball 10/Underdog contests.


### Position sizing
Given the high variance nature of the game we are playing, along with the top heavy payout structure in these contests it is important that I understand my monetary exposure to these contests should realistically expect to be cut in fourth to cut in half in the bottom outcomes performance wise.

With that understanding, the draft kings millionaire best ball tournament will be my highest exposure tournament that I will max out in. I will have 150 teams in it, and it will be my main focus. 

- At $20 an entry, 150 teams will equate to $3,000 of exposure on DraftKings.

Throughout the summer, the other large field tournament available will be Best Ball Mania 3 on Underdog. At $25 per entry, I am split on participating in this. It will be the sharpest field I’m considering playing in, with the community of drafters being ones focused on structure, player profiles, and have a lot of the same takes as myself. It would seem to me that I don’t have as much edge here as I do with the Draftkings tournament which at a surface level probably has a weaker field. On top of that, in order to have a good 'shot' at being on the right side of variance at the end of the year, this is also the most costly way to do so, with the most top heavy prize structure there is.

**Due to this, I will commit to not participating at all in best ball mania 3.**

*Maybe this changes next year with confirmed edge and profitability, for now it just doesnt make sense considering my bank roll*

The DraftKings tournament will be my highest monetary exposure into a single contest, and while I won't be participating in the best ball mania tournament on Underdog... I will be participating in the lower stakes, less efficient tournaments called 'the Puppy'. Last summer (2021) there were three iterations of the puppy on Underdog. Each tournament was $5 per entry, 150 max entry alike the bigger tournaments. 

The 3 puppies occured during the following dates in 2021:

- The Puppy 1, July 5th - July 15th. 56k total entries.
- The Puppy 2, August 2nd - August 12th. 111k total entries.
- The Puppy 3, August 16th - Sept 9th. 223k total entries. 

Assuming a similar schedule for the puppies, if EV is my #1 priority, I don't think participating in the first Puppy is the best idea. As the July puppy will likely have the least favorable drafting conditions. Only the serious (*ish*) best ball players draft before August. On top of that, its a deadzone for information, resulting in a lot of variance. It does not seem like a tournament I want to max out, at $750 it would be **almost a quarter of my total planned exposure**. 

I however plan on maxing both the Puppy 2, and especially the Puppy 3. As those tournaments will have the most information availible, resulting in the least amount of variance, if there are 'average' best ball players it will be more likely they are drafting in the later puppies than the early ones. 

- At $5 an entry, 150 teams in the Puppy 2 and 150 teams in the Puppy 3 will equate to $1,850 of exposure on Underdog (adding in pre draft big board and rookies and sophomores.
